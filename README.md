## reward token

1 reward token = 1 usd.




### reward rate 
- based on eth price 
- the longer a person is in the stake the higher the reward rate goes, so everyday there is a increase


- want to incentivize users to stake again, 
even if the current ETH price is lower than their initial stake,
 you can adjust the reward rate dynamically based on whether they are restaking and the 
 current ETH price relative to their initial stake


 also holds in account in the focumale how much time left of the stake, the earlier someone stakes the more rewardtokens




 If its the first deposit, hold in count how long the stake is gonna last, so if they invested early they get more reward rate, also if they do more, it should increase,  and use the ETH price to see reward token

if they deposit for the second time, they should be able to use the initial deposit amount price if it was higher otherwise use current
